# ANTH-641_Week-4
Excercise 4_2 changes made in Petra Excavation Trenches Data Set:
* Merged duplicate cells in Context (4)
* Changed "Trench 14,20, and Spec. Proj. 22,24,29" to "Trench 14,20, and Special Projects 22,24,29" to keep the standardized way of writing Special Projects in Context (4)
* Merging the cells in the Label column was made difficult by the clustering since it included question marks which would not be good to merge with the other rows but it was not easy at first to get rid of just one of the proposed rows within the recommended cluster
  * I was able to browse each individual recommended cluster to be able to view possible discrepancies within the cluster (which was often just an added space) and edit them
  * I clustered multiple rows including Locus 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 11?, Stray Find, and Stage 3, No Loci
